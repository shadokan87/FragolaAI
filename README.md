# 🍓 Fragola AI

FragolaAI is a work in progress coding assistant designed to enhance the development process. Once completed, users will be able to alternate between chat and build modes. In chat mode, developers can ask general coding questions or questions about the codebase, while build mode focuses on making medium to large-scale changes in the codebase while maintaining context. FragolaAI leverages static code analysis and agentic AI features to provide fast, context-aware assistance.
